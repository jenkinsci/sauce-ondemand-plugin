# This docker compose file has 3 services: Jenkins, Forwarder (a proxy), and a browser (Firefox)
# Jenkins is built from a Dockerfile (Jenkins.Dockerfile) that is in the same directory as this file
# Jenkins is inside a network that has no access to the outside world (intnet), therefore it needs
# to use the forwarder (proxy) container to access the outside world.
# Since Jenkins is inside a network that has no access to the outside world, we would need to
# configure a reverse proxy to access Jenkins from the outside world. To avoid that, we are using
# a Firefox container that is in both networks (intnet and extnet), and from there load Jenkins.
# This way, we can access Jenkins # by using noVNC and going into the Firefox container.
# Go to http://localhost:7900/?autoconnect=1&resize=scale in a browser to access the Firefox
# container.
# How to run this? -> docker-compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up --build
